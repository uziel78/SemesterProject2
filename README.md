# SemesterProject2
My Semester Project 2 at Noroff

The Project is a pure HTML/CSS and Javascript project, where I have created a website that allows me to do all CRUD operations on the content that I have made and stored on a wordpress webiste, using the wordpress API alongside the "JWT Autentication for WP-API" plugin by Enrique Chavez.
